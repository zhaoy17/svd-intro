# An Introduction to SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

The content of this website is a brief introduction to the concept of singular value decomposition, a way of decomposing an arbitrary matrix into the multiplication of three matrices. There are four webpages the user can get to throug the nevigation bar:

Home: give a brief definition of SVD

Copmuting SVD: talk about the components (U, $\Sigma$, and V) can be computed through finding the singular values of the matrix

PCA: Relating SVD with PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Applications: Talk about where SVD is used in real life
